There are two main reasons for sending spam:

- [a website infection]({{< ref "sites/clean-up-a-site" >}}), or
- a password theft. We will present the latter case here.

----

When the alwaysdata team encounters spam sent due to a password theft, they will:

- stop sending by changing the password for the affected e-mail address,
- delete all related e-mails awaiting sending,
- warn the customer.

Then the customer can provide a new, **more secure**, password to again allow access to their address.

In repeat cases, the alwaysdata team can always *suspend* the account until the customer returns.
