To be sure to receive emails from specific addresses and domains, they can be defined in **Emails > Configuration**. The incoming antispam will no longer affect their emails.

Mails sent to these addresses will always undergo the [antispam validation]({{< ref "e-mails/delivery#notation-system" >}}).
