## HTTP Default Site

This option, for VPS and dedicated servers and managed in the **HTTP** menu of the server, allows you to specify a site to which requests arriving on the server will be redirected, whose address is not defined in the alwaysdata administration interface. This will replace the "*Site not found*" returned by default.

It is useful when there are addresses pointing to the server at the DNS level but they are not set in **Web > Sites**. This can, for example, be the case of a site with a very high number of addresses - that you don't want to declare all in **Sites** - or a forgotten address.
