To connect to your account using *FTP*, you need to have a user. By default, a user with your *account* name was created with the account. You can create as many FTP users as you wish and you can administer them from your administration interface, from the **Remote access > FTP** tab.

- Name: FTP user name prefixed with your account name,
- Password: the password assigned to the user,
- Root directory: the directory where the user finds their connection.

FTP proposes isolation: the user cannot move around freely in their root directory's parent directories.
