[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is a "non-linear web notebook". It is dedicated to organizing snippets of information (such as *notes*, *images*, and more) by saving them and smartly link them. It can be served as a static HTML file or using a [Node.js]({{<ref "languages/nodejs">}}) site.

## Installation

Our marketplace offers a script to install the last version of *TiddlyWiki* automatically via the **Web > Sites > Install an application** menu of the alwaysdata administration interface.
