## Transfer from another hosting provider

You will need to change:

- the *ps_shop_domain*, `ps_shop_domain_ssl` settings in the `ps_shop_url` and `ps_configuration` tables in the database,
- the **localhost** value of the `physical_URL` setting in the `ps_shop_url` table with **/**,
- the file `$HOME/path/to/the/application/app/config/parameters.php`.

## Email sending

The use of `/usr/sbin/sendmail` is not functional. Please choose to set your "own SMTP parameters" and simply provide the SMTP hostname of your account (given in the menu **Emails > Addresses** of your alwaysdata admin interface).
