## Signing up for a [Private Cloud]({{< ref "accounts/billing/private-cloud-prices" >}}) plan

To sign up to these offers, contact us by [ticket](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/), [e-mail](https://www.alwaysdata.com/en/) or [phone](tel:+33184162340) and we will guide through the various steps.

There are no installation charges but a minimum three month commitment is required when purchasing a Dedicated/Gold server. If the purchaser does not wish to make this commitment, the server price will be increased by 20% during the first three months.

## Grouping invoices

It is possible to choose the day of the month for invoicing, a solution that is more flexible and practical when you have a number of subscriptions (hosting, IP address, etc.).

To do this, go to **Billing > Payment methods > Settings > Invoicing day**.

{{< fig "images/payment-methods.en.png" "Set up the invoicing day" >}}

A *prorata invoice* (for each product subscribed to) is generated when this function is implemented so as to align dates.

## Changing the company name

To change the company name, go to the **Profile** tab and subsequent invoices will be issued to the new entity. If an invoice has just been issued, you can *exceptionally* contact [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add) and get them to generate a new one.

## Finding a customer number / alwaysdataâ€™s bank references

These are available from **Billing > Transactions > Credit the account** or **Billing > Payment methods > Credit the account**.

## Quotations and proforma invoices

Invoices are issued when a service is delivered. We can however issue quotations and proforma invoices on request. Contact [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add).

## Deleting before expiry

No refund will be made when an account is deleted or a server decommissioned before it expires.
