# Rust

The way [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Rust on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- Rust is a compiled language that does not need an interpreter to run the programs but [version]({{< ref "languages/rust/configuration">}}#version) 1.78 is available.
- Its [HTTP deployment]({{< ref "languages/rust/configuration">}}#deployment-http) is simple.
