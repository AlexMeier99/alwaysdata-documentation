# Python

The way [Python](https://www.python.org) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Python on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisionned versions]({{< ref "languages/python/configuration">}}#supported-versions) range from 2.4 to 3.10,
- the [environment configuration]({{< ref "languages/python/configuration" >}}#environment) is easy to set up.

The [Django]({{< ref "/languages/python/django">}}) and [Flask]({{< ref "/languages/python/flask">}}) frameworks are part of our autoinstallable applications and many other applications are also compatible. For example, [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/), [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/), [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/), [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) or even [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).
