# Deno

The way [Deno](https://deno.land/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Deno on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- Several [versions]({{< ref "languages/deno/configuration">}}#supported-versions) are available (from 1.0 to 1.37).
- the [environment configuration]({{< ref "languages/deno/configuration" >}}#environment) is easy to set up.
