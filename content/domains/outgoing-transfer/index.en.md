To transfer a domain to another host services provider, initiate the command from the new provider.

## Preparation

Before starting the operation the owner needs to:
  - remove the protection against transfers,
  - check that the ownerâ€™s information is correct and visible in the `whois` [^1],
  - retrieve the authorization code.

This information is retrieved from the **Domains > Details of [example.org] - ðŸ”Ž** tab:

A transfer cannot be made during the first 60 days after creation or after a previous transfer.
