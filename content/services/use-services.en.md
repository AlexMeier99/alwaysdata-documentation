Set up a service (i.e. headless running command) in your Administration Panel: **Advanced > Services**.

The ports' range `8300` to `8499`, as well as the hostname `services-[account].alwaysdata.net`[^1] are reserved to those services.

**Important**:

- It must runs in `foreground`, not fork and leave [^2].
- When needing to be reached from an external application, bind it to `::` (_IPv6_) and a port from `8300` to `8499`.
- Log files for running services are located at `$HOME/admin/logs/services/`, containing services' outputs.
	- An extract of these logs is presented in the administrationâ€™s interface (**Logs** - ðŸ“„).
- The restart of a service sends the `SIGHUP` signal.
* For Public Cloud users:
  - Services are executed on a distinct servers than SSH and HTTP servers.
  - Their resources use must remain fair.
  - The services will not be available on IPv4, only on IPv6.
* For [Private Cloud]({{< ref "accounts/billing/private-cloud-prices" >}}) users:
	- Range port `8300` to `8499` are *not* accessible from the external network. You can expose them to Internet using a [firewall rule]({{< ref "security/network/configure-firewall" >}}).

{{% notice note %}}
Private clouds users can also bind on another IP than `::` and listen on ports outside of the range `8300-8499`, but this is *not recommended* as it may lead to issues during [migrations]({{< ref "advanced/migrations" >}}).
