In this example, we will consider our domain name is *domain.tld*.

1. Go in **Domains > Details of domain.tld (star wheel) > DNS records**;
2. Choose **Add DNS record**;
3. Fill in the form.

> Don't put the root in **Hostname**. For example, by putting _www.domain.tld_ in this box, we will create a record for _www.domain.tld.domain.tld_.
