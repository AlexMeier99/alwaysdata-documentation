This article explains how to transfer a domain _and_ its associated malboxes to another alwaysdata account.

In the **Domains** section of the original account, choose the **Transfer to another account** action and follow steps.

> Only the _account owner_ can initiate the transfer but, unlike the website transfer, it does not need permissions on the destination account.
>
> The destination profile will just need to accept it in the **Transfers** section and wait the mailboxes copy on its account. As this action depends on the mailboxes size it can take time.
