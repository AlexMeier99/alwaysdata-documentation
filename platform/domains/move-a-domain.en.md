> Only the _account owner_ can initiate the transfer but, unlike the website transfer, it does not need permissions on the destination account.


The destination profile will just need to accept it in the **Transfers** section and wait the mailboxes copy on its account. As this action depends on the mailboxes size it can take time.


> To move it in another of _its_ accounts, juste enter its own email address.
