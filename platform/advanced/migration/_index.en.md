# Migration

A migration is an operation that involves changes to technical features of your account. For example, a migration could be an upgrade to a new version of MySQL.

Available migrations are shown in the menu **Advanced > Migrations** in the alwaysdata administration. New migrations are continuously added, and we send out email notifications to our clients to keep them informed.

Some migrations are optional: we let you choose whether or not to perform them. Others are mandatory: you have a certain time limit to perform these. Once its deadline is reached, a migration is automatically performed if it hasn't yet been.
