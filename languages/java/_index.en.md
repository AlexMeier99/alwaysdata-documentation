# Java

The way [Java](https://www.java.com/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Java on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisioned versions]({{< ref "languages/java/configuration">}}#versions-supported) are 1.8/1.11/1.14,
- the [environment configuration]({{< ref "languages/java/configuration" >}}#environment) is easy to set up.

All programs using the *JVM* ([Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for example) can run via the [user program]({{< ref "sites/user-program" >}}).
