[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) is a web development framework written in the functional programming language Elixir, that uses a server-side [model-view-controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern.

## Installation

A *Phoenix* Hello World is one of our applications that are auto-installable via the administration interface: **Web > Sites > Install an application**.

- [Install script](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/site/application/script/23/detail/)

Phoenix 1.6 is not compatible with our infrastructure as it needs Elixir 1.12 which depends on Erlang 22. This ill be upgraded during the next software infrastructure [migration]({{< ref "advanced/migrations" >}}).
