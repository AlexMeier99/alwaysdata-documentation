This program gives formers the opportunity to invite their students to host projects with these advantages:

- Every student will have their *free* account,
- The former will have *technical permissions* on all of the accounts belonging to their students,
- These accounts are limited to *200 Mbytes* of disk space,
- Our security mechanism will not block your IP address if it detects numerous requests from the same origin (e.g. from a school class).

To benefit from this [open a ticket](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/). The program is free of charge for public establishments and available via partnerships for private entities.

Once the formation is over, students can keep their accounts, delete the [permissions]({{< ref "accounts/permissions" >}}) granted to their former, and eventually [change plan]({{< ref "accounts/billing/upgrade-your-plan" >}}).
