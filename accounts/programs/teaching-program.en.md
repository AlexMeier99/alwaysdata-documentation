This program provides teachers with a place to host their student's projects.

- Every student will have their *free* account,
- The teacher will have *technical permissions* on all of the accounts belonging to their students,
- These accounts are limited to *200 Mbytes* of disk space,
- Our security mechanism will not block your IP address if it detects numerous requests from the same origin.

To benefit from this [open a ticket](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/). This is free of charge for public establishments and available via partnerships for private entities.

Once classes are out, students can keep their accounts using [change plan]({{< ref "accounts/billing/upgrade-your-plan" >}}) and delete the [permissions]({{< ref "accounts/permissions" >}}) granted their teacher.
