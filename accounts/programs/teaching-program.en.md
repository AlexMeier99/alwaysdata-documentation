This program gives teachers a place to host their students's projects.

- each student will have its _own_ free account;
- the teacher will have _technical rights_ on all its students's accounts;
- these accounts are limited to _200MB_ of disk space;
- our security layer won't blacklist the IP if it detect massive requests from all students.

To get it, [open a ticket](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/). It is free of charge for public schools and via partnership for private institution.


Once the class is finished students can keep their account, [change of plans]() and remove the [permission]() given to their teacher.
