## Transferring an account to another person

Go to **Accounts > Transfer to another user**. Specify the e-mail address of the target profile that can accept it from the **Transfers** tab in their client interface. This will close the current subscription and open a new one in the target profile.

If you only have one account you can just as easily change the profile information in **Profile** with no need to use the transfer process.

## Changing an account name

It is not currently possible to change an account name. Here is a way to work around this issue:

1.  Create a new account using the new name,
2.  Move the [sites]({{< ref "sites/move-a-site" >}}) and [domains]({{< ref "domains/move-a-domain" >}}) to it,
3.  Delete the former account,
4.  Contact [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/) so that they will handle billing.

## Automatic deletion cycle

A profile is automatically deleted *30 days* after its suspension. To avoid this, corrective action is required.

If the reason for suspension is unclear, refer to your tickets, notifications and alerts from your alwaysdata administration interface.
