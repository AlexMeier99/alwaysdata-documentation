Two things: you can delete an account (superman) or your profile (superman@example.tld).

For the first one, go on the **Accounts** menu and click on the trashbin. That will delete all attached domains, email addresses, websites, files, databases...
For the second one, go on the **Profile** menu and click on _Delete this profile_. That will delete all attached accounts and history.
