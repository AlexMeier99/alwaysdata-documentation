Go in  **Accounts** menu of your client interface. After clicking in **Add account** you will face a form to choose:

- its name;
- the plan;
- the type of billing engagment (monthly or yearly);
- its localization: shared servers, VPS or dedicated server.

If the account is on a VPS or dedicated server, the plan and billing engagment aren't meaningful.
