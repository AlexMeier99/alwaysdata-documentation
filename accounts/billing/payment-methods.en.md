There are various ways to pay your alwaysdata invoices.

## Prepaid account

Every invoice issued debits your prepaid alwaysdata account for the amount owed. You need to credit this prepaid account to cover your debits.

We offer the following options:

- Credit card,
- PayPal,
- Check: send your check to *ALWAYSDATA - 91 Rue du Faubourg Saint HonorÃ©, 75008 Paris, France* (made out to *ALWAYSDATA*). Also state your *customer number* or your *bill number* on the back of the check,
- Bank transfer: make your transfer to our [bank account](https://static.alwaysdata.com/docs/IBAN.pdf) stating your *customer number* or your *bill number* in the transfer comments.

Credits to your account by *bank transfer* or *check* will appear in your interface as soon as they have been processed by our team. This may take a few days.

### Credit cards are accepted

The credit cards accepted by our payment service provider are: Visa and MasterCard.

## Direct debit

Enter your charge information - bank account or card number - in your administration access, in the **Billing > Means of payment** menu.

This means of payment will be automatically debited the amount due. You no longer need to worry about paying for your alwaysdata hosting.

When you choose a direct debit from your bank account, provide your bank with a [debit authorization](http://static.alwaysdata.com/docs/Prelevement.png).
